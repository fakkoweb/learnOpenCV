Erode

Erodes an image by using a specific structuring element.

The function erodes the source image using the specified structuring element 
that determines the shape of a pixel neighborhood over which the minimum is taken:

dst(x,y) = min _((x',y'): element(x',y') != 0) src(x+x',y+y')

The function supports the in-place mode. 
Erosion can be applied several (iterations) times. 
In case of multi-channel images, each channel is processed independently.
