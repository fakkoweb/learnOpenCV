Add Weighted

Calculates the weighted sum of two arrays.

The function addWeighted calculates the weighted sum of two arrays as follows:

dst(I)= saturate(src1(I)* alpha + src2(I)* beta + gamma)

where I is a multi-dimensional index of array elements. 
In case of multi-channel arrays, each channel is processed independently.
