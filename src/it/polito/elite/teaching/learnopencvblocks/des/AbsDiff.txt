AbsDiff

Calculates the per-element absolute difference between two arrays or between an array and a scalar.

The function absdiff calculates:

Absolute difference between two arrays when they have the same size and type: 
dst(I) = saturate(| src1(I) - src2(I)|)

Absolute difference between an array and a scalar when the second array is constructed from Scalar or has as many elements as the number of channels in src1: 
dst(I) = saturate(| src1(I) - src2|)

Absolute difference between a scalar and an array when the first array is constructed from Scalar or has as many elements as the number of channels in src2: 
dst(I) = saturate(| src1 - src2(I)|)

where I is a multi-dimensional index of array elements. In case of multi-channel arrays, each channel is processed independently.

Note: Saturation is not applied when the arrays have the depth CV_32S. You may even get a negative value in the case of overflow
