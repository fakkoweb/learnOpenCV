Laplacian

Calculates the Laplacian of an image.

The function calculates the Laplacian of the source image by adding up 
the second x and y derivatives calculated using the Sobel operator:

dst = Delta src = (d^2 src)/(dx^2) + (d^2 src)/(dy^2)

This is done when ksize > 1. When ksize == 1, 
the Laplacian is computed by filtering the image with the following 3 x 3 aperture:
